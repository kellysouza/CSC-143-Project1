    Welcome to the WorldRunner sandbox! Here's a place where you can test your little world
    and imagine yourself in it. Ideally, you should work here only when you're passing all tests.

    Completion of these programming challenges is optional and will not be graded.
    However, there is a 99% chance that a similar problem will appear on an upcoming exam,
    so, maybe give them a try?
